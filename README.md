# Sport-s-Person-s-image-Classing-
In this project i have to classify sports person by their face. So we to collect the dataset and clean and then predict by using ML algorithm

In this data science and machine learning project, we classify sports personalities. We restrict classification to only 5 people,


1. Serena Williams
2. Virat Kohli
3. Roger Federer
4. Lionel Messi
5. Maria Sharapova

Here is the folder structure,

UI : This contains UI website code
server: Python flask server
model: Contains python notebook for model building
google_image_scrapping: code to scrap google for images
images_dataset: Dataset used for our model training
Technologies used in this project,

Python
Numpy and OpenCV for data cleaning
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
Sklearn for model building
Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
Python flask for http server
HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI

We use the google_image_scrapping code to scrape google images for our dataset. We then use the images_dataset folder to store the collected images.

We pre-process the images using Numpy and OpenCV. We then use Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization. We then use Sklearn to build the classification model.

We use the model folder to store the model code. We then use the python flask server to deploy our model. Finally, we use HTML/CSS/Javascript to create our UI.
